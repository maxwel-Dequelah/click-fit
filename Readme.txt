The webapp has been done in HTML CSS, Js, Jquery, Node(Express) and Mysql,

all the task dependancies are within the node module, or linked directly to the HTMl or Index.js file.

The Mysql Database has however been extracted to clickfit.spl found within the backend folder.

I have not implimented the route handler for the uploadUser post request.

The app is as well avilable via my Github repo https://github.com/maxwel-dequelah/click-fit
